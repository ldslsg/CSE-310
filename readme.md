## Overview

**Project Title**: Hello World

**Project Description**: Print "hello world" in C++

**Project Goals**:Finish Week 01 assignment

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. #include <iostream>: This includes the standard input/output library. 
2. int main(): This defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. 
3. std::cout << "Hello, World!";: This outputs the string “Hello, World!” to the console.
4. return 0;: This indicates that the program has successfully terminated to the operating system.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* We need a .cpp file that contains the C++ source code. For example, you can save the “Hello, World!” code provided earlier in a file named hello.cpp. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the C++ code using the cd command. For example: cd /path/to/your/directory.
* We can compile the source code using a C++ compiler, the most common of which is g++. You can compile the code by entering: g++ hello.cpp -o hello. Here, hello.cpp is the name of the source file you want to compile, and -o hello specifies the name of the generated executable file as hello.
* Once the compilation is successfully completed, you can run the executable file as follows: ./hello.
When you execute this command, the message “Hello, World!” is printed to the terminal.
